#Image Processing Preview Client#

An application to quickly reapply filters on images and export them in batch amounts.

Created for use at the Molecular Biophotonics Lab at UW, in order to adjust parameters for false-coloring images to simulate the look of Hematoxylin and Eosin staining; however, this application is presented as a library that can be used for any general image filter adjustment function. 

Full falsecolor application is a private repository.
